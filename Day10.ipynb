    "Unless, that is, you can design a replacement for the device's video system! It seems to be some kind of cathode-ray tube screen and simple CPU that are both driven by a precise clock circuit. The clock circuit ticks at a constant rate; each tick is called a cycle.\n",

Specifically, the sprite is 3 pixels wide, and the X register sets the horizontal position of the middle of that sprite.
